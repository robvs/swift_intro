# Swift - Beyond the Basics

This presentation is an introduction to Swift that focuses on some of Swift's more interesting features (i.e. cool things you can do with enumerations and switch statements, etc.), while only briefly touching on its basic syntax (it's easy enough to use reference materials for details on basic syntax).

The target audience is experienced developers who are not familiar with swift.

When presenting this material, it is recommended to comment-out the entire file, then uncomment short blocks in turn as the code is discussed. Also display the Debug area at the bottom so that the audience can view results that aren't shown in the pane on the right.
